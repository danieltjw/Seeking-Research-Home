# Seeking Research Home

The author is seeking a home for his research.

Growing up in a place where the persecution and deaths of those of a non-dominant sexual orientation has been celebrated as the will of a divine being has made him feel uncomfortable even though he is straight. His dissent and freethinking nature may eventually place him in the same camp.

The author seeks a place where he can dedicate fully to his research without wasting energy looking for a conducive environment.
